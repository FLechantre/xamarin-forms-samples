KwazyThreeDee
=============

**KwazyThreeDee** (or "Quasi-3D") was seen in the Xamarin Evolve 2014 talk [Xamarin.Forms is Even Cooler than You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79SdhVjBwh0). 
It demonstrates the use of BoxView to mimic 3D vector graphics in Xamarin.Forms. 

The **Sphere** option over-burdens all the platforms. All but the simplest figures cause the Android garbage collector to slow down the animation.
