KwazyThreeDee
=============

**KwazyThreeDee** (or "Quasi-3D") was seen in the Xamarin Evolve 2014 talk [Xamarin.Forms is Even Cooler than You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79SdhVjBwh0). 
It demonstrates the use of BoxView to mimic 3D vector graphics in Xamarin.Forms. 

The **Sphere** option over-burdens all the platforms. All but the simplest figures cause the Android garbage collector to slow down the animation.

As of November 19, 2015, it was updated to Xamarin.Forms 2.0, and a UWP project was added, but it hasn't been updated since.
