PageFlipper
===========

PageFlipper is a simple demo of using the *RotateYTo* animation
method to implement a 3D-ish ebook page flip. 

Largely due to the platform-dependent implemetation of *RotateYTo*,
the program works best on Windows Phone, less well on the iPhone, 
and rather terrible on Android.
