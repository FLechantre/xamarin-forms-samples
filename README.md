xamarin-forms-samples
=====================

This repository contains samples for Xamarin.Forms that were written by Charles Petzold 
but which are not in
[https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples),
or in 
[*Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*](http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms)
usually because they demonstrate unorthodox techniques, 
or because they don't work very well,
or because they push the outside of the envelope to the point where it breaks.

As of July 20, 2015, all samples have been updated to Xamarin.Forms 1.4.3.6376.

The **RotatingSpokes** sample has been removed because it's included in Chapter 22 of *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*.

The **PageFlipper** sample has also been removed because the technique is illustrated in the **SwingingEntrance** sample in Chapter 22 of *Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms*.

Which means that the only project left is **KwazyThreeDee**.
