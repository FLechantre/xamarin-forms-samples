RotatingSpokes
==============

RotatingSpokes was seen in the Xamarin Evolve 2014 talk
[Xamarin.Forms is Even Cooler than You Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79SdhVjBwh0). 
It demonstrates the use of *BoxView* to mimic vector graphics lines
in Xamarin.Forms. Several *BoxView* lines are arranged in a pattern of spokes,
then the entire array of spokes is rotated, and finally, each *BoxView* line is 
rotated around its center, creating an interesting pattern.

The program runs on iPhone, Android, and Windows Phone.
